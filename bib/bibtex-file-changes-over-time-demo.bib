  abstract = {PDMS films of 10 Î¼m thickness can be patterned within 30 min by combining
	dry etching to achieve substantially vertical sidewalls with wet
	etching to achieve high etch rates and to protect the underlying
	substrate from attack. Dry etching alone would have taken 5 h, and
	wet etching alone would produce severe undercutting. In addition,
	using either technique alone produces undesirable surface morphologies.
	The mask used during etching is critical to a successful patterning
	outcome. E-beam evaporated Al was found to work well, adhering strongly
	to oxygen-plasma-treated PDMS and holding up well during both dry
	and wet etching. To prevent wrinkling of the PDMS, a fast deposition
	rate should be used.},
