  Abstract                 = {PDMS films of 10 Î¼m thickness can be patterned within 30 min by combining
 dry etching to achieve substantially vertical sidewalls with wet
 etching to achieve high etch rates and to protect the underlying
 substrate from attack. Dry etching alone would have taken 5 h, and
 wet etching alone would produce severe undercutting. In addition,
 using either technique alone produces undesirable surface morphologies.
 The mask used during etching is critical to a successful patterning
 outcome. E-beam evaporated Al was found to work well, adhering strongly
 to oxygen-plasma-treated PDMS and holding up well during both dry
 and wet etching. To prevent wrinkling of the PDMS, a fast deposition
 rate should be used.},
