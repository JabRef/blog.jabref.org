In spirit of this year's winter olympics 🇮🇹 ❄️ 🏟️, we are proud to announce a winner as well: A new JabRef version...
And JabRef once again got accepted for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026/organizations/jabref-ev)

We are happy to announce the release of **JabRef 6.0 Alpha 5**, the next step towards the stable version of JabRef 6.0.

## Release Highlights

This release focused on improving the citations tab interface and including new fetchers for citations based on [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/) and [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) as well as fixing some bugs related to migration from an older version or the startup ob linux ARM systems.
As always we polished the user interface and improved the usability.

If you have books entries in JabRef, it's now possible to automatically fetch book covers for these entries. You can enable it in the preferences.
