We are proud to announce the release the next milestone of JabRef. Today we are releasing Jabref 5.0.

## Notable Changes and New Features
The major difference is the completely reworked UI technology. This comes with default support for high dpi monitors.
In addtion, this allowed us to implement an additonal dark theme and to increase the usability of the JabRef user interface. 

//TODO: INSERT image 

This lays the foundation to support custom themes in future.
While we worked hard on creating a stable release, we also implemented a couple of new features:
- We reintroduced the possibility to extract references from plain text (using [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid)). 
- We improved the display of group memberships by adding multiple colored bars if the entry belongs to more than one group. #4574
- We added a new feature that allows to (automatically) search for citations in LaTeX files.
In addtion, we added the LaTeX-Citations tab to the entry editor which quickly allows to show all files in which the current entries.
- We reworked the [JabRef-Browser integration plugin](https://github.com/JabRef/JabRef-Browser-Extension) (JabFox) which in addtion to Firefox now also works for Chromium based browsers 
- We added a new fetcher for ADS (SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System) and also changed all fetchers to use secure HTTPS instead of HTTP.
- We optimized the performance for working with a shared SQL database
- We did tons of bugfixes. For more details check out our  [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)


## Installation

With the release of the 5.0 we switched to a new native Java build system which allows us to bundle a custom Java runtime together with JabRef.
This means that problems with other installed or outdated java versions on the system are a problem of the past.
For the installation we now offer self-containing `.deb` and `.rpm` files for Linux users and in addtion to the usual installer for Windows.
We also offer a portable zip version of JabRef which also includes all necessary files to run JabRef.
No installed Java version required.

**You can get it from [FOSShub](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html).**
