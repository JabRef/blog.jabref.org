We are proud to announce the release the next milestone of JabRef. Today we are releasing Jabref 5.0.
The major difference is the completely reworked UI technology.


## Installation

With the release of the 5.0-beta we switched to a new native Java build system which allows us to bundle a custom Java runtime together with JabRef.
This means that problems with other installed or outdated java versions on the system are a problem of the past. This also means it's no longer possible to start JabRef directly from the jar.  
For the installation we now offer self-containing `.deb` and `.rpm` files for Linux users and in addtion to the usual installer for Windows.
We also offer a portable zip version of JabRef which also includes all necessary files to run JabRef.
No installed Java version required.

## Read Before Installing

Since Jabref 5.0 is a Major Release, you should be aware that not all features are fully compatible with older version of JabRef

## Special Thanks

The Core [JabRef Developers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/DEVELOPERS) would like to give special thanks to all new and old contributors. Since 4.0 we are very happy to see so many new contributors opening pull requests and making translations.
Special thanks goes to two temporary contributors who have significantly contributed to this release. You rock!

* **Martin Simon**, who wrote his Master's Thesis about the Usability of JabRef and gave us valuable advice how to improve it.
* **David MÃ©ndez**, who was our Google Summer of Code Student in 2019 and developed the [LaTeX Integration tools](http://blog.jabref.org/#june-11-2019-%E2%80%93-google-summer-of-code-2019-user-interface) and the [LaTeX Citations Tab](http://blog.jabref.org/#august-06-2019-%E2%80%93-google-summer-of-code-2019-latex-citations-tab).

We also want to thank all the users who are constantly testing the latest snapshots and giving feedback!
