## CSL Styles

We now support CSL styles by their short name (e.g. apa), and we fixed some issues regarding the usage in LibreOffice.

- Hanging idents are now rendered correctly in LibreOffice documents
- We fixed an issue where bibliography entries generated from CSL styles had leading spaces. #13074
- We added "Bibliography Heading" to the available CSL bibliography header formats in the LibreOffice integration. #13049

## Known Issues

This is an alpha release, and we are still actively working on multiple issues. Some of them may be a regression to the last stable minor release of the 5 major series. Use the alpha release for testing only, and do not forget to backup your libraries.

Be aware that currently the [update notification is broken](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/13000). It will inform you that a new version of JabRef is available, even though you have downloaded the latest release. Just ignore the notification.
