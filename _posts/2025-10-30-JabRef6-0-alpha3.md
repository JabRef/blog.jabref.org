Trick or treat! Happy Halloween from the JabRef team!
We are happy to announce the release of **JabRef 6.0 Alpha 3**, the next step towards the stable version of JabRef 6.0.
This alpha release brings a huge number of bug fixes, improvements, and new features, as well as some changes under the hood in the machine room of JabRef, to make future improvements easier and JabRef more versatile.

As always, since this is an alpha release, we strongly recommend making a backup of your .bib files before updating.

## GSoC

Two of our contributors, [Wanling](https://github.com/wanling0000) and [Yubo](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao) have already finished their projects ([Git support](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/GSoC-2025-%E2%80%90-Git-Support-for-JabRef) and [Welcome Walkthroughs/Welcome Tab](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/GSoC-2025-%E2%80%90-Walkthrough-and-Welcome-Tab)).
[Philip](https://github.com/palukku) is already on the finishing line and you can already test the [Cite-As-You-Write](https://blog.jabref.org/2025/07/25/cayw-endpoint/) feature he introduced.
We are very proud to present their work in this release.

## CSL Styles and Libre Office integration

We now support CSL styles by their short name (e.g. apa), and we fixed some issues surrounding their usage in LibreOffice.

## Known Issues

This is an alpha release, and we are still actively working on multiple issues. Some of them may be a regression to the last stable minor release of the 5 major series. Use the alpha release for testing only and backup your libraries before and during use.
