From Friday, September 6 to Monday, September 9, 2023 the annual [JabCon](https://jabcon.jabref.org/) took place in Zwiesel, Germany, where the majority of the JabRef maintainers and some members of our non-profit organization JabRef e.V. met in person and worked together to improve JabRef and discuss the roadmap for future releases 🐱💻☕.
We are happy to announce that JabRef e.V. now has 22 members who support JabRef's development in various ways and keep us motivated.

This year we discussed various aspect of JabRef and focused on architectural improvements and bug fixes. The final goal is to be able to use parts of JabRef independently as library, commandline, and server without GUI for e.g. integrity check or cleanup operations as part of a toolchain.
For most JabRef users, the positive side effect of this is an improved user experience due to a better stabiltiy and reduced

We are excited for next year's JabCon.
