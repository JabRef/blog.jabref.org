We are thrilled to announce the release of JabRef version 5.10, a significant update to our beloved reference management software.
This release comes with a plethora of new features, improvements, and fixes that make managing your bibliographic data smoother than ever.
Have a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of all changes.

## Highlighted Features:

### Enhanced External Changes Resolver Dialog

Say goodbye to confusion when resolving external changes! We've added a field that shows the BibTeX/biblatex source for added and deleted entries, giving you more context to make informed decisions ([#9509](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9509)).

### Optimized Backup Management

* **Smarter Backups**: JabRef now writes a new backup file only if there is a change, reducing unnecessary backups ([#9679](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9679)).
* **Streamlined Backup Paths**: Backups of libraries are now collected together in a more organized manner. The backup path can be configured in the preferences as well.

### User-Specific Comment Field

Collaboration just got easier with our new user-specific comment field. Multiple users can now make separate comments on the same entry ([#543](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/543)).

### Refinements and Reorganization for Better Usability

Weâ€™ve reorganized and streamlined menus, making them more intuitive. In particular, we moved the preferences menu command from the options menu to the file menu. ([#9768](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9768)).

### Integration with External Tools:

* **E-mail and Kindle:** We integrated two mail actions ("As Email" and "To Kindle") under a new "Send" option in the right-click & Tools menus. The Kindle option creates an email targeted to the user's Kindle email, which can be set in preferences under "External programs" ([#6186](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6186))
* **Sublime Text:** We added support for pushing citations to Sublime Text 3 ([#10098](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10098)).

### Improved Fetcher

* **GVK fetcher**: You can now use the GVK fetcher to search inside the new [K10plus](https://wiki.k10plus.de/) catalog ([#10189](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10189)). 
* **ICAR eprints** Automatically fetch full texts from IACR eprints with our new fetcher ([#9651](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9651)).
* **BVB fetcher**: The german [Bibliotheksverbund Bayern](https://www.bib-bvb.de/) can now be searched in with our new experimental fetcher and parser for the [MarcXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/) format ([#9461](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9641)).

### Secure Credential Storage

We now encrypt and store your proxy password and custom API keys in the OS's native credential store, enhancing security ([#10044](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10044)).

### Fulltext Search Upgraded

We've upgraded to Lucene 9.7 for full-text search, and as a result, the search index will be rebuilt for better performance ([#9584](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9584)).

### New User contributed themes

You are looking for more color in your life? Our new theme collection has you covered!
We have collected a couple of user contributed _Dark Themes_ and _Light Themes_ at our new theme website [themes.jabref.org](https://themes.jabref.org/).
A huge thanks to all theme creators!

### GDPR compliance

We have paid special attention to the GDPR compliance. We have implemented a detailed [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) and options to disable all online connections ([#10064](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10064)).

### ... and more!

This barely scratches the surface. With improved support for parsing file paths, MathML, custom entry types, and a host of other enhancements, this is the update you don't want to miss.
