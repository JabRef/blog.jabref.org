We are thrilled to announce the release of JabRef version 5.10, a significant update to our beloved reference management software.
This release comes with a plethora of new features, improvements, and fixes that make managing your bibliographic data smoother than ever.
Here’s a rundown of what’s new:

## Enhanced External Changes Resolver Dialog

Say goodbye to confusion when resolving external changes! We've added a field that shows the BibTeX/biblatex source for added and deleted entries, giving you more context to make informed decisions ([#9509](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9509)).

## User-Specific Comment Field

Collaboration just got easier with our new user-specific comment field. Multiple users can now make separate comments on the same entry ([#543](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/543)).

## Improved Search Capabilities

* **Search History**: Easily access your search history with a new list in the search field’s right-click menu ([#7906](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7906)).
* **DOI Search**: You can now search for a DOI directly from 'Web Search' ([#9674](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9674)).
 
## Improved Fetcher

* **GVK fetcher**: You can now use the GVK fetcher to search inside the new [K10plus](https://wiki.k10plus.de/) catalog [#10189](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10189. 
* **ICAR eprints** Automatically fetch full texts from IACR eprints with our new fetcher ([#9651](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9651)).

## Seamless File Attachments

* **Attach File from URL**: Easily download and store a file with your reference library by attaching it directly from a URL ([#9646](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9646)).
* **Automatic Online File Download**: When you create a new entry from an existing ID (e.g., DOI), \[Software Name\] can now automatically download online files associated with it ([#9756](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9756)).
* **Automatic renaming of files**: When you try to add a file with illegal characters, JabRef now offers the option to replace the illegal characters before adding the file.

## InspireHEP Integration

Update an existing entry with data from InspireHEP with ease ([#9351](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9351)).

## Refinements and Reorganization for Better Usability

We have made numerous refinements in the interface to improve the user experience.

* **Menus Revamped**: We’ve reorganized and streamlined menus, including the preferences menu command, making them more intuitive ([#9768](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9768)).
* **Library Management**: We refined the ‘main directory not found’ error message for clarity, and improved the unlinking/deletion of multiple linked files ([#9625](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9625), [#9473](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9473)).
* **Better Group Management**: The `Add Group` dialog now uses the most recently selected group hierarchical context, and we’ve reworked cross-ref labels in the entry editor ([#9141](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9141), [#10046](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10046)).

## Fulltext Search Upgraded

We've upgraded to Lucene 9.7 for full-text search, and as a result, the search index will be rebuilt for better performance ([#9584](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9584)).

## Optimized Backup Management

* **Smarter Backups**: JabRef now writes a new backup file only if there is a change, reducing unnecessary backups ([#9679](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9679)).
* **Streamlined Backup Paths**: Backups of libraries are now collected together in a more organized manner. Backup path can be configured in the preferences as well.

## Enhanced Logging

`log.txt` now contains more detailed information, including an entry if a BibTeX entry could not be parsed and debug messages. We’ve also reduced log clutter by omitting entries for non-found files during PDF indexing ([#9678](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9678)).

## Improved Importer

Our Medline importer has been improved to correctly import ISO dates for `revised` ([#9536](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9536)).

## Secure API Key Storage

We now encrypt and store custom API keys in the OS's native credential store, enhancing security ([#10044](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10044)).

## Multi-Language Support for MS Office Integration

Export to and import references from MS Office in multiple languages ([#9699](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/9699)).

## Enhanced Group Management

* **Groups List Scrolling**: Move groups effortlessly by scrolling in the groups list ([#2869](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/2869)).
* **Drag and Drop for Groups Field**: A new drag-and-drop feature for the ‘Groups’ field in the entry editor panel ([#569](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/569)).

## ... and more!

This barely scratches the surface. With improved support for parsing file paths, MathML, custom entry types, and a host of other enhancements, this is the update you don't want to miss.
