title:  JabRef 5.11 Release
categories: [Release]
---


We are publishing version 5.11 of JabRef! What a surprise! The decision to release JabRef 5.11 so soon after JabRef 5.10, was taken, because some regressions have been found (and fixed) that seemed to be annoying enough to warrant an early release, especially for macOS users. Despite the bug fixes, we also implemented a couple of new features and performance improvements.

macOS users should install the `.pkg` as it takes care of the correct installations for the JabRef browser extension.

Have a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of all changes.

## Highlighted Features

### Explorer citation relation

A major new feature is the possibility to explore citations and (and add) papers that cite or are cited by a given paper.

### Improved Push to external applications

The citation format can now be fully customized e.g. (e.g., [@key1,@key2]) and thus not only LaTeX-style citations but also markdown (e.g. pandoc-style) are possible. In addition, macOS can now push to [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/)

### Improved integrity check

We added an integrity check for more special LaTeX characters.

### Fetcher and Importer

We added a new fetcher for [LOBID](https://lobid.org/) resources and we improved the performance of some importers and fetchers. Some fetchers like CrossRef now also return additional data and the ISBN fetcher no longer returns the entry type `misc`.

### Improved Fetchers

* **GVK fetcher**: You can now use the GVK fetcher to search inside the new [K10plus](https://wiki.k10plus.de/) catalog ([#10189](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/10189)). 
* **ICAR eprints** Automatically fetch full texts from IACR eprints with our new fetcher ([#9651](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9651)).
* **BVB fetcher**: The german [Bibliotheksverbund Bayern](https://www.bib-bvb.de/) can now be searched in with our new experimental fetcher and parser for the [MarcXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/) format ([#9461](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/9641)).

### Secure Credential Storage

We now encrypt and store your proxy password and custom API keys in the OS's native credential store, enhancing security ([#10044](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10044)).

### New Themes Contributed by Users

We now have a new theme that allows line wrapping in the entry table. A special thanks to [Ryan Carpenter](https://github.com/ryan-carpenter) who contributed this theme.

### ... and more!

**You can get JabRef as free software from [FOSShub](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html).**

In case you notice any bugs or problems, please browse through our [bug tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues) and consider submitting a new bug report if nobody else has been reporting the failure before.

## Known Issues

Some of our fetchers currently show connection problems. We are investigating these issues and try to find a solution for this. In the meantime you can use the [JabRef Browser Extension](https://docs.jabref.org/collect/jabref-browser-extension)

## IMPORTANT: Build Instructions from Source for Linux Users

You no longer need JabRef's own jdk fork, you can now use the official JDK 21.0.1 as a minimum version.
