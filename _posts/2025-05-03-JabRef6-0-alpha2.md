## Release Highlights

This release focuses on improving the user experience, CSL support, and adding helpful quality-of-life enhancements.

### Better onboarding and a fresh start

To help new users get started more easily, we've introduced:

- A brand-new Welcome tab shown when no database is open. [#12272](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/12272)
- A more accessible empty-library screen, with buttons to add an example entry or import existing PDFs. [#12662](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/12662)

It is now easier than ever to get started with JabRef.

We‚Äôve continued to expand the LibreOffice integration:

- You can now customize the bibliography title and formatting for CSL styles. [#12663](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/12663)
