Happy 19th birthday, JabRef!

Today marks an important milestone for us here at JabRef - 19 years of reference management excellence!

We want to take a moment to thank all of our users for their continued support and for choosing JabRef as their reference management software. Your feedback and suggestions have helped us to improve and grow over the years, and we could not have done it without you.

We also want to extend a special thank you to our past developers, who have helped to lay the foundation for JabRef and have contributed to its success. Your hard work and dedication have not gone unnoticed, and we are grateful for all that you have done.

As we celebrate this birthday, we look forward to the future and all that is yet to come. We are committed to continuing to provide the best reference management experience possible, and we can't wait to see what the next 19 years will bring.

Thank you again for being a part of the JabRef community. Here's to many more years of success!
