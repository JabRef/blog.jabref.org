title: Try out any JabRef pull request
---

Thanks to the strong eco system of Java, one can easily try out (nearly) any JabRef pull request.
For instance, to try out the "[initial implementation of walkthrough](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/13182)", one needs to execute following command:

    .\gg.cmd just run-pr 13182

As preparation, one needs to clone jabrefs source code and download [`gg.cmd`](https://github.com/eirikb/gg) and place it into the source coe directory.

The preparation is also simplified by `gg.cmd`.

1. [Download `gg.cmd`](https://github.com/eirikb/gg/releases/latest/download/gg.cmd)
2. Execute `.\gg.cmd jbang https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/.jbang/CloneJabRef.java`. This will clone JabRef into a temporary folder.

For Linux and macOS, use `sh ./gg.cmd` instead of `.\gg.cmd`.
