Great news! JabRef got accepted as an open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
The goal of this annual program is to give open source newcomers the opportunity to learn about and get involved in open source development.
People will work up to three months on a project for an open source organization and are mentored by members of the project.
It is a great honor for JabRef to be part of this program again.

From March 18, 2024 to April 02, 2024 [people can apply](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/jabref-ev) for participation in the GSoC.
Interested people are [invited to have a look at our list of possible project ideas](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/GSOC-2024-ideas-list) or suggest their own projects.
We offer small projects (90), medium projects (175h) and large projects (350h).

We are looking forward to introducing motivated people to the open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open source project.

Interested? Check our [contribution guidelines](https://devdocs.jabref.org/contributing#contribute-code) and prepare a first improvement.
In parallel, you can think of the project you would like to work on.

Stay tuned for further updates!
