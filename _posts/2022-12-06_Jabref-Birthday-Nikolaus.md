Last week, on November 29, it was JabRef's 19 birthday! Yep. That old already ðŸ˜‰. While the original creators Morten O. Alver and Nizar Batada are no longer active developing at JabRef, they are the ones who led the foundation in 2003 for the basis of JabRef. And even though they are no longer on board, we have a couple of users who still use JabRef since the early days!

Over the years JabRef has seen many contributors coming and going, and we would like to thank all of them for their various contributions. This not only includes code but also ideas and translations!

Fast-forward to December 2022, we are planning the release of Version 5.8 around the upcoming holidays. Now is a good point to test the latest development version and report any issues you encounter.

We are excited about the upcoming release and the cool new features! ðŸ˜Ž

## Special Thanks

We want to thank all the users who are constantly testing the latest snapshots and providing feedback!
Furthermore, we would like to thank our [donators](https://donations.jabref.org) and JabRef e.V. members who made it possible for many JabRef developers to attend the conference and to support our work.
In case you like to donate money on a regular basis, we would prefer via our bank account (tax-deductible and no fees) or via GitHub Sponsors as the fees are lower than PayPal.
