Today is "Black Friday" and we decided to offer a very special deal for you: **JabRef 5.0 Beta**!
We are proud to announce the release of the first beta of JabRef 5.0!
Since the alpha release of Jabref 5.0 we continued fixing bugs and doing small usability improvements.

In total, there are at least 40 major bugfixes in the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v5.0-beta/CHANGELOG.md) which makes JabRef more stable and performant than the previously released 5.0-alpha of August.



We also would like to thank all of our various contributors, translators and donors! This helps us a lot!
