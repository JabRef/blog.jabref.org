Since the alpha release of Jabref 5.0 we continued fixing bugs and doing small usability improvements.

In total, there are at least 40 major bugfixes in the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v5.0-beta/CHANGELOG.md) which makes JabRef more stable and performant than the previously released 5.0-alpha of August.



We also would like to thank all of our various contributors, translators and donors! This helps us a lot!
