Today is "Black Friday" and we decided to offer a very special deal for you: **JabRef 5.0 Beta**!  
We are proud to announce the release of the first beta of JabRef 5.0! ðŸš€ 

Since the [alpha release](http://blog.jabref.org/#august-27-2019-%E2%80%93-jabcon-2019-jabref-5-0-alpha-release) of Jabref 5.0 we continued fixing bugs and doing small usability improvements.

In total, there are at least 40 major bugfixes in the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v5.0-beta/CHANGELOG.md) which makes JabRef more stable and performant than the previously released 5.0-alpha of August.


After feedback on the new integrated preview next to the entry editor on the alpha version, we added an an option to show the preview as an extra tab in the entry editor (instead of in a split view).

One major feature of the upcoming 5.0 release is the "Dark Theme" which has been improved since the alpha 5.0. The "Dark Theme" can be enabled in the preferences under the tab "Appearance".
